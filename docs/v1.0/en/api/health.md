# Health API

This API can be used for measuring node health.

To get an HTTP status code response that indicates the node's health, make a `GET` request to `/ext/health`.
If the node is healthy, it will return a `200` status code.
If you want more in-depth information about a node's health, use the methods below.

## Format

This API uses the `json 2.0` RPC format. For more information on making JSON RPC calls, see [here.](./issuing-api-calls.md)

## Endpoint

```http
/ext/health
```

## API Methods

### health.getLiveness
Get health check on this node.

#### Signature 
```go
health.getLiveness() -> {
    checks: {
        network.validators.heartbeat: {
            message: {
                heartbeat: int
            },
            timestamp: string,
            duration: int,
            contiguousFailures: int,
            timeOfFirstFailure: int
        }
    },
    healthy: bool
}
```

* `chains.default.bootstrapped`
     * `timestamp` is the timestamp of the last health check.
     * `duration` is the execution duration of the last health check in nanoseconds.
    * `contiguousFailures` is the number of fails that occurred in a row.
    * `timeOfFirstFailure` is the time of the initial transitional failure.
* `network.validators.heartbeat`
    * `heartbeat` is the unix timestamp of the last time the network handled a message.
    * `timestamp` is the timestamp of the last health check.
    * `duration` is the execution duration of the last health check in nanoseconds.
    * `contiguousFailures` is the number of fails that occurred in a row.
    * `timeOfFirstFailure` is the time of the initial transitional failure.

More information on these measurements can be found in the documentation for the [go-sundheit](https://github.com/AppsFlyer/go-sundheit) library.
