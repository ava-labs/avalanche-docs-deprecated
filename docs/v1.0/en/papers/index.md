# Papers

This section contains technical papers that the Avalanche network uses simply as a general reference for its implementation. However, these references are not binding and the actual implementation of the Avalanche network may be different from what is written in these documents.

## [Avalanche Whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08936.pdf)

This paper describes Avalanche, the family of consensus algorithms
that allows Avalanche to process thousands of transactions per second with low latency and low energy usage.

## [Avalanche Platform Specification](https://files.avalabs.org/papers/platform.pdf)

This paper is a technical description of the Avalanche network.

## [AVAX Token (AVAX) Specification](https://files.avalabs.org/papers/ava-token.pdf)

This paper describes the mechanics of AVAX, the Avalanche network's native token.
